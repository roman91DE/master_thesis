# Literature Review

## DAE-GP: Denoising Autoencoder LSTM Networks as Probabilistic Models in Estimation of Distribution Genetic Programming 

Wittenberg, Rothlauf, Schweim(2020)

Main Idea: Mutation and Crossover in GP is replaced by a probabilistic model

Probabilistic model: Denoising Autoencoder long short-term memory networks (DAE-LSTMs), an artificial neural network

### Results

* Increased performance on generalized version of the royal tree problem if compared to standard GP, Performance improves with higher problem complexity

* Creates offspring with higher fitness than standard GP





## To Research

* Denoising Autoencoder long short-term memory networks
* Royal Tree Problem
* EDA and EDA-GP (Estimation of Distribution Algorithm)
